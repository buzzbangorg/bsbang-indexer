# bsbang-indexer
Apache Solr indexer for the [Buzzbang crawl data format](https://github.com/buzzbangorg/buzzbang-doc/wiki/Buzzbang-crawl-data-format)

## Getting Started
**Step 1: Create a virtual environment and clone this repo**

```
pip3 install virtualenv
python3 -m venv buzzbang
source buzzbang/bin/activate
git clone https://github.com/buzzbangorg/bsbang-crawler-ng.git
cd bsbang-crawler-ng
```

**Step 2: Install Python dependencies**

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 3: Put initialization arguments in the config/setting.ini file**

The defaults are probably going to be fine but you might want to check them.


**Step 4: Install Solr**

** Past this point, we still need to implement indexing of data into Solr **

Install Solr on your system.

Once installed, you may check the running status using the command - ```service solr status``` and you can access the UI in your browser at ```localhost:8983/```

**Step 5: Create a Solr core named buzzbang**

```
sudo su - solr -c "/opt/solr/bin/solr create -c buzzbang"
```

If you used a different installation location for Solr, use that particular Solr bin path to create a core.  

```
cd $SOLR/bin
./solr create -c buzzbang
```

TIP: To delete a Solr core permanently, execute the following on the terminal - 

```
sudo su - solr -c "/opt/solr/bin/solr delete -c buzzbang"
```  

**Step 6: Setup and configure buzzbang**

```
./bsbang-solr-setup.py <path-to-specifications-directory> 
```

Next, open SolrUI on a browser and select the core where the data is to be indexed. Check the directory location where the Solr core data is going to be saved and relace the solrconfig.xml in that directory with conf/solrconfig.xml file. This will enable the de-duplication mode in solr indexing. You may need root access to replace this file.

Example:

```
./bsbang-solr-setup.py secifications
```

**Step 7: Use the query and spell check module**

```
./bsbang-query.py <words>
./bsbang-spellCheck.py <single-word>
```

Example:

```
./bsbang-query.py "treatment conditions"
./bsbang-spellCheck.py extrct
```
